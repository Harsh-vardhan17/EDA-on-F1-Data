# Exploratory Data Analysis 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/817b79bd-a8b6-44f4-aa23-f64627f60072)


## This project presents an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Formula 1 historical data, including races, drivers, constructors, lap times, pit stops, and safety incidents. Visualizations are generated using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.

## 📂 Project Contents

- `EDA_on_F1_Data.ipynb` – Main notebook containing analysis, plots, and insights
- `.csv` files – Datasets used (races, drivers, constructors, lap_times, etc.)
- `README.md` – This file

## 📊 Key Insights Covered

- Top drivers and constructors by points & championships
- Circuit usage trends across seasons
- Safety incidents: red flags, safety car, fatal accidents
- Fastest average lap times
- Sprint race results and impact
- Circuit world map with Plotly
- Year-over-year team & driver participation
- Visuals: bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, heatmaps

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harsh-vardhan17/EDA-on-F1-Data.git
cd EDA-on-F1-Data
```

## 2. Run the Notebook
You can open the notebook using:

Jupyter Notebook

VS Code with Jupyter extension

Google Colab (upload manually)

3. Install Required Libraries
```bash

## 🚀 Future Works
🔄 Race Simulation & Strategy
⏱️ Simulate a race strategy model using Monte Carlo simulation (e.g., pit stop timing, weather impact)

💡 Build a decision engine to predict tire choices based on race pace & degradation

🎥 Visual Enhancements
📽️ Animated charts using Plotly or matplotlib.animation (e.g., evolving driver standings)

📍 Driver career map: visualize wins by country for each driver

📊 Dashboard using:

Streamlit or Plotly Dash (interactive filters for season, driver, constructor)

Tableau (live race dashboards)

🔗 API Integration
📡 Use the Ergast API for live F1 data updates

🔄 Automate data ingestion from Formula1.com or FastF1 Python package

🧹 Data Engineering
🗃️ Create a SQLite/PostgreSQL backend to run real-time SQL queries

🔁 Automate daily updates with GitHub Actions or cron jobs
